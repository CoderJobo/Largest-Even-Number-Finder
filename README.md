# Largest-Even-Number-Finder
Program to find the largest even number in an array

LargestEvenNumberFinder is a class that, when instantiated, creates an object to find the largest  
even number in an array of ints.  There are two constructors; one takes an int array and the other 
generates an array of random numbers with the size of the array and the largest possible number 
being provided by the user.

CheckLargestEvenNumberFinder contains a main method which  checks the two constructors and the 
getter and printing methods and prints messages to screen to show the findings.

LargestEvenNumberFinderJUnitTest uses JUnit to test the LargestEvenNumberFinder class.
